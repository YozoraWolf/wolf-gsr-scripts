# Wolf's GSR Scripts

GSR ([gpu-screen-recorder](https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/about/)) is an effective screen recorder for Linux that allows a similar function to shadowplay on windows.

I'm making this repo public so that others could take these scripts to use for their personal setups and follow the way I save my videos. Do take in account that you'll have to edit them properly to make them work on your end.
